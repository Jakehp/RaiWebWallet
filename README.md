# RaiWebWallet

- Wallet.js contains the wallet itself. All the signing, ciphering, storing, and PoW stuff. <br/>
- js/custom.js basically links the wallet with the UI. So users can use it. Yep. <br/>
- Block.js handles all the stuff related with blocks (transactions). Creates blocks, computes hashes, etc ... <br/>
<br/>
pack it all with browserify js/custom.js -o main.js<br/>
<br/>
BTW, currently its not stable. Still in testing phase. <br/>
<br/>
Feel free to contribute and post all the issues you find :)<br/>

(Hmmm, I have to spend some time on a proper readme :P )<br/>
